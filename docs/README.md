# Time Machine

Browse, compare, and restore previous versions of your notes using Obsidian's built-in file-recovery snapshots.

## Key features

- **Timeline slider** to scrub through snapshots of your notes
- **Colored diff view** showing exactly what changed between a snapshot and your current file
- **Selective restore** -- restore an entire version or just individual changes (hunks)
- **Auto-updates** when you switch files -- no manual refresh needed
- Works on **desktop and mobile**

## Quick start

1. Make sure the **File Recovery** core plugin is enabled in **Settings -> Core plugins**
2. Install and enable Time Machine
3. Open the command palette and run **Time Machine: Open view**
4. The sidebar panel shows snapshots for the active file -- use the slider to browse them

## Prerequisites

Time Machine reads snapshots created by Obsidian's built-in **File Recovery** core plugin. If File Recovery is disabled, Time Machine will show a message asking you to enable it.

File Recovery creates snapshots automatically at a configurable interval (default: every 2 minutes). You can adjust this in **Settings -> Core plugins -> File Recovery**.

# Time Machine

Browse, compare, and restore previous versions of your notes using Obsidian's built-in file-recovery snapshots and git commits.

## Key features

- **Timeline slider** to scrub through snapshots of your notes
- **Colored diff view** showing exactly what changed between a snapshot and your current file
- **Comparison modes** -- compare against the current file (cumulative) or the next version (incremental)
- **Selective restore** -- restore an entire version or just individual changes (hunks)
- **Git integration** -- git commits appear alongside File Recovery snapshots on the same timeline (desktop only)
- **Source indicators** -- each snapshot shows its origin (File Recovery or git commit with hash and message)
- **Smart deduplication** -- identical snapshots across sources are merged, keeping only the most recent
- **On-demand snapshots** -- force-create a File Recovery snapshot at any time via command
- **Auto-updates** when you switch files -- no manual refresh needed
- Works on **desktop and mobile** (git features are desktop-only)

## Quick start

1. Make sure the **File Recovery** core plugin is enabled in **Settings -> Core plugins**
2. Install and enable Time Machine
3. Open the command palette and run **Time Machine: Open view**
4. The sidebar panel shows snapshots for the active file -- use the slider to browse them

If your vault is a git repository, git commits will automatically appear on the timeline alongside File Recovery snapshots.

## Snapshot sources

Time Machine reads from two sources:

- **File Recovery** -- Obsidian's built-in core plugin that automatically saves snapshots at a configurable interval (default: every 2 minutes). Works on all platforms.
- **Git** -- If your vault is inside a git repository and you're on desktop, Time Machine fetches the commit history for each file. This is read-only; Time Machine never creates commits or modifies the repository.

If File Recovery is disabled, Time Machine will show a notice but still work if git is available. If neither source has data for a file, an empty state message is shown.
